# MyCheckers
It's a simple checkers game made with core java.

Start the "Start" class to start.

It's my first git hub public project and I encourage you to make your contributions. 
As a beginner, I might have lots of redundent lines, that one could have obtained if had been writing this type of program.

Your contributions will be reviewed and possibly added to this project!
